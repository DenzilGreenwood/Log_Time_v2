# Final Referee-Proof Edits Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of 10 precise, drop-in edits designed to make the LTQG paper completely referee-proof. These edits address every potential point of pushback while maintaining the mathematical rigor and core theoretical content.

## Global Verdict Confirmed
- **σ-QM/QFT**: ✅ Correct - Chain-rule, σ-Schrödinger, and unitary evolution validated
- **Asymptotic silence**: ✅ Proven under broad conditions with finite total phase
- **Cosmology (Weyl)**: ✅ FLRW curvature mapping to constant $\tilde{R} = 12(p-1)^2$ correct
- **Overall Assessment**: ✅ NO ERRORS THAT MAKE THE IDEA WRONG

## Implemented Edits

### 1. Domain & Reparameterization Scope (Introduction)
**Location**: First occurrence of $\sigma = \log(\tau/\tau_0)$ in introduction
**Added**: "Throughout we assume $\tau > 0$ along each timelike worldline, so $\sigma = \log(\tau/\tau_0)$ is a $C^1$ bijection $\mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}$. All results in Sections 2–3 are therefore reparameterizations of the same dynamics, not modifications of the Hamiltonian theory."
**Purpose**: Establishes clear scope - this is reparameterization, not new physics

### 2. σ-Generator as Bookkeeping (Quantum Mechanics §3.1)
**Location**: Right after defining $K(\sigma) = \tau_0 e^\sigma H(\tau_0 e^\sigma)$
**Enhanced**: "We emphasize $K(\sigma)$ is the generator in $\sigma$ induced by the Jacobian $d\tau = \tau_0 e^\sigma d\sigma$; it is not a new Hamiltonian but a bookkeeping re-expression of $H$ under the clock change."
**Purpose**: Prevents misreading as physical modification of theory

### 3. Prediction Claims Tied to Theorems (QFT Introduction)
**Location**: §5 opening claim about preserving QFT predictions
**Added**: Cross-reference to specific theorems proving Bogoliubov unitarity, particle number, and $\tau$-$\sigma$ mode equivalence
**Purpose**: Anchors claims to rigorous mathematical proofs

### 4. Particle Number Basis Dependence (QFT §5.7)
**Location**: Immediately after Theorem 5.6 (particle number)
**Enhanced**: "As usual in QFT on curved spacetime, $n_k = |\beta_k|^2$ is basis/vacuum dependent (e.g., adiabatic scheme). Our invariance results concern the equality of predictions between $\tau$ and $\sigma$ given the same prescription, not a coordinate-independent notion of particles."
**Purpose**: Preempts standard referee objection about coordinate-independent particles

### 5. Wronskian Conservation Clarification (QFT §5.5)
**Location**: Right after equations (104)–(105)
**Enhanced**: "Here 'conservation' means the Wronskian obeys the exact scaling law $W(\sigma) = W_0 e^{-(1-3p)\sigma}$ induced by the first-order system, which is the appropriate $\sigma$-analog of constancy."
**Purpose**: Clarifies terminology precision

### 6. Weyl Derivation Index/Signature Fix (Cosmology §4.2)
**Location**: Lines computing $(\nabla \ln \Omega)^2$ and $\square \ln \Omega$
**Fixed**: Explicit signature convention and correct index placement: $(\nabla \ln \Omega)^2 = g^{00} (\partial_0 \ln \Omega)^2 = -t^{-2}$ and corrected d'Alembertian to get final result $\tilde{R} = 12(p-1)^2$
**Purpose**: Removes any index/sign convention ambiguity

### 7. Frame Dependence Emphasis (Cosmology §4.2)
**Location**: §4.2 final paragraph
**Enhanced**: "The constancy of $\tilde{R}$ is a conformal-frame statement. It does not, by itself, imply geodesic completeness or remove singular behavior in the original FLRW frame without a specified matter-coupling prescription."
**Purpose**: Honest scope boundary for conservative reviewers

### 8. Adaptive Solver Drift Resolution (Computational Validation §6)
**Location**: After tolerances specification
**Added**: "In early experiments, fixed-step integrators exhibited apparent 'Wronskian drift'; switching to adaptive RK with strict $(rtol, atol) = (10^{-10}, 10^{-12})$ eliminated this artifact, matching the analytic scaling law."
**Purpose**: Documents computational robustness and artifact resolution

### 9. Sufficient Conditions Note (Appendix A.1)
**Location**: Right after Theorem A.1 (asymptotic silence)
**Enhanced**: "These conditions are sufficient (not necessary). Many Hamiltonians of physical interest satisfy at least one case (power-law, logarithmic, or super-exponential), ensuring $K(\sigma) \to 0$ and finite phase $\int \|K\| d\sigma$."
**Purpose**: Strengthens mathematical narrative

### 10. Code Cross-Reference (QFT §5.4)
**Location**: After first-order system equations (101)–(102)
**Added**: "Equations (101)–(102) are exactly the system integrated in our code (adaptive RK); diagnostics compute Wronskian, energy per mode, and instantaneous $(\alpha_k, \beta_k)$ to verify constraints during evolution."
**Purpose**: Ties mathematical framework to implementation validation
