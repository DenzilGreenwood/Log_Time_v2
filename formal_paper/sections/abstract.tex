I present a mathematically rigorous framework that bridges General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics through temporal reparameterization, which I term Log-Time Quantum Gravity (LTQG). The central insight I develop is that the logarithmic time coordinate $\sigma := \log(\tau/\tau_0)$ (defined for $\tau > 0$) converts General Relativity's multiplicative time-dilation factors into additive shifts, naturally aligning with Quantum Mechanics' additive phase evolution.

I establish four fundamental mathematical results: First, I prove the exact invertibility and unitary equivalence of quantum evolution between proper time $\tau$ and log-time $\sigma$ coordinates, preserving all physical predictions (proved in §\ref{sec:quantum_mechanics}) while enabling asymptotic silence as $\sigma \to -\infty$. Second, I demonstrate that pairing this temporal reparameterization with conformal Weyl transformations—a separate geometric analysis from the re-clocking—regularizes curvature singularities in FLRW cosmologies, yielding finite constant curvature $\tilde{R} = 12(p-1)^2$ for scale factors $a(t) = t^p$. Third, I show that quantum field theory mode evolution maintains Wronskian conservation and Bogoliubov unitarity across coordinate systems with sub-$10^{-6}$ numerical precision. Fourth, I identify operational distinctions between $\sigma$-uniform and $\tau$-uniform measurement protocols that could be experimentally detectable.

My comprehensive computational validation suite, implementing these theoretical results through symbolic computation and high-precision numerical analysis, confirms all mathematical claims to machine precision. The framework preserves the complete physical content of both General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics while providing new tools for studying early universe cosmology, black hole physics, and quantum gravity phenomenology.

This work represents a reparameterization approach rather than a modification of existing theories, offering a mathematically consistent bridge between the multiplicative temporal structure of spacetime geometry and the additive temporal evolution of quantum systems. While the framework faces fundamental conceptual limitations—including frame-dependence in singularity resolution and the unresolved Problem of Time in canonical quantum gravity—it provides valuable computational tools and theoretical insights. The computational implementation provides reproducible verification of all theoretical claims and serves as a foundation for future research in quantum gravity and cosmology.
