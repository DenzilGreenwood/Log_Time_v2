# Review Improvements Implementation Summary - Pages 31-End

## Overview
This document summarizes the final improvements made to the main.pdf LaTeX source files based on the detailed review covering Pages 31-end (computational validation, results & discussion, appendices). All suggestions have been implemented to enhance scope clarity, prevent referee pushback, and strengthen the presentation without changing the core mathematics.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Computational Validation Robustness (Pages 31-36)

#### Adaptive Integrator Documentation (computational_validation.tex)
- **Enhanced Methodology Note**: Added explanation that all numerical integrations employ adaptive Runge-Kutta methods to ensure robust evolution
- **Drift Artifact Prevention**: Specifically noted that adaptive methods eliminate numerical drift artifacts that can appear with fixed-step integrators
- **Technical Context**: Emphasized particular importance for systems with anti-damping characteristics or rapid time-scale variations
- **Purpose**: Preempts "numerics vs. physics" concerns and documents the resolution of earlier Wronskian drift issues

### 2. Conformal Frame Claims Refinement (Pages 37-41)

#### Curvature Regularization Clarification (results_discussion.tex)
- **Precise Language**: Updated curvature regularization description to specify "in the conformal frame"
- **Geodesic Completeness Disclaimer**: Added explicit statement: "no claim is made about geodesic completeness of the original spacetime"
- **Frame Context**: Clarified that $\tilde{R} = 12(p-1)^2$ represents curvature regularization in the Weyl frame specifically
- **Purpose**: Prevents over-interpretation of singularity resolution claims

#### Enhanced Frame Dependence Limitation (results_discussion.tex)
- **Prominent Physical Caveat**: Expanded the frame dependence limitation to emphasize that curvature regularization occurs in the conformal frame
- **Matter Coupling Prescription**: Added note that physical interpretation requires specifying how matter fields couple in each frame
- **Einstein vs Conformal Frame**: Clarified that regularized curvature doesn't automatically imply resolution of physical singularities without proper matter coupling prescription
- **Purpose**: Addresses the critical frame-dependence issue that referees will focus on

### 3. Mathematical Foundation Strengthening (Appendix A)

#### Sufficient vs Necessary Conditions Note (appendix_mathematical_proofs.tex)
- **Scope Clarification**: Added important note that the asymptotic silence conditions (power-law, logarithmic, exponential decay) are sufficient but not necessary
- **Broader Applicability**: Emphasized that many physically relevant Hamiltonians satisfy these or similar conditions
- **Framework Independence**: Clarified that the framework's invariance and physical predictions don't depend on any particular asymptotic class
- **Physical Relevance**: Noted that the analysis establishes asymptotic silence for a broad range of physically meaningful scenarios

## Review Assessment Confirmation
