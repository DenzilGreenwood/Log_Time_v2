\title{Log-Time Quantum Gravity: Reclocking Quantum Dynamics and Regularizing Early-Time Geometry}

\author{Denzil James Greenwood}

\date{\today}

\begin{abstract}
I present \emph{Log-Time Quantum Gravity} (LTQG), a framework that reclocks quantum dynamics using the logarithmic time variable $\sigma=\ln(\tau/\tau_0)$ and pairs it with a conformal rescaling of the background geometry. I establish (i) unitary equivalence of Schr\"odinger evolution in $\tau$ and $\sigma$, including time-ordered non-commuting Hamiltonians; (ii) an ``asymptotic silence'' regime as $\sigma\to -\infty$ in which the effective generator vanishes with finite accumulated phase; and (iii) geometric regularization in flat FLRW cosmology under a Weyl transform $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}=\Omega^2 g_{\mu\nu}$ with $\Omega=1/t$, yielding an Einstein, constant-curvature spacetime with $\tilde R=12(p-1)^2$ and $\tilde R_{\mu\nu}\tilde R^{\mu\nu}=\tilde R^2/4$, $\tilde K=\tilde R^2/6$. 

On the quantum field side, I show numerical equivalence (to tight tolerances using adaptive RK and phase-robust diagnostics) between $\tau$- and $\sigma$-time mode evolution for free scalars in expanding backgrounds, while fixed-step tests correctly expose anti-damped $\sigma$-regimes as expected. For Schwarzschild backgrounds with spatially varying $\Omega(r,t)$, I compute invariants \emph{directly from} $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$, capturing derivative contributions from the conformal factor.

\textbf{Disclaimer.} I propose LTQG here as a \emph{candidate} resolution strategy for early-time pathologies and clockâ€“geometry alignment. I invite independent verification and stress testing of the mathematics, numerics, and physical implications. A complete open-source validation suite accompanies this work.

\section{Introduction}
Reconciling quantum mechanics (QM) with dynamical spacetime remains central to quantum gravity~\cite{weinberg1989}. Two persistent challenges are: (i) the role of ``time'' as a parameter in QM versus a dynamical field in general relativity (GR), and (ii) singular early-time behavior in cosmology and near horizons. I propose \emph{Log-Time Quantum Gravity} (LTQG), which (a) reclocks quantum evolution via $\sigma=\ln(\tau/\tau_0)$ and (b) aligns this reclocking with a Weyl rescaling of the metric. The resulting $\sigma$-picture preserves QM while rendering certain geometric and dynamical limits well-posed.

\section{Log-time mapping and quantum dynamics}\label{sec:logtime}
Define $\sigma=\ln(\tau/\tau_0)$ so that $\tau=\tau_0 e^{\sigma}$ and $\partial_\sigma = \tau\,\partial_\tau$. The $\tau$-Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}
i\hbar\,\partial_\tau \ket{\psi(\tau)}=H(\tau)\ket{\psi(\tau)}
\end{equation}
is equivalent to the $\sigma$-equation
\begin{equation}
i\hbar\,\partial_\sigma \ket{\psi(\sigma)} = H_{\mathrm{eff}}(\sigma)\ket{\psi(\sigma)},\qquad
H_{\mathrm{eff}}(\sigma)=\tau_0 e^\sigma\, H(\tau_0 e^\sigma).
\end{equation}
\textbf{Proposition 1 (Unitary equivalence).} For arbitrary (piecewise continuous) $H(\tau)$, including non-commuting time dependence, the time-ordered evolution operators satisfy
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{T}\exp\!\Big[-\tfrac{i}{\hbar}\!\int_{\tau_i}^{\tau_f} \!H(\tau)\,d\tau\Big]
=\mathcal{T}\exp\!\Big[-\tfrac{i}{\hbar}\!\int_{\sigma_i}^{\sigma_f} \!H_{\mathrm{eff}}(\sigma)\,d\sigma\Big],
\end{equation}
with $\tau_{i,f}=\tau_0 e^{\sigma_{i,f}}$. Hence density matrices and Heisenberg observables coincide in the two clocks.

\textbf{Asymptotic silence.} As $\sigma\to-\infty$, $H_{\mathrm{eff}}(\sigma)\to 0$ and the accumulated phase $\int_{-\infty}^{\sigma} H_{\mathrm{eff}}\, d\sigma'=\tau_0 e^{\sigma}$ is finite, making the $\sigma$-past a mathematically tame initialization surface.

\section{Weyl rescaling and geometric regularization}\label{sec:weyl}
We pair the clock map with a conformal rescaling $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}=\Omega^2 g_{\mu\nu}$. For flat FLRW $ds^2=-dt^2+a(t)^2 d\vec x^2$, $a(t)=t^p$, choose $\Omega=1/t$. Using the 4D Weyl identity,
\begin{equation}
\tilde R = \Omega^{-2}\Big(R-6\\, \ln\Omega - 6\\,(\nabla \ln\Omega)^2\Big),
\end{equation}
one finds
\begin{equation}
\tilde R = 12(p-1)^2,\qquad 
\tilde R_{\mu\nu}=\frac{\tilde R}{4}\,\tilde g_{\mu\nu},\qquad
\tilde R_{\mu\nu}\tilde R^{\mu\nu}=\frac{\tilde R^2}{4},\quad
\tilde K=\frac{\tilde R^2}{6}.
\end{equation}
Thus the transformed spacetime is Einstein and constant curvature; all curvature scalars are finite constants for any $p$.

\section{QFT in the $\sigma$-picture}\label{sec:qft}
For a free scalar mode $u_k$, the $\tau$-equation maps to
\begin{equation}
u_k'' + (1-3p)\,u_k' + t(\sigma)^2\,\Omega_k^2\big(t(\sigma)\big)\,u_k=0,\qquad t(\sigma)=\tau_0 e^{\sigma},
\end{equation}
where prime is $\partial_\sigma$. Using complex adiabatic initial data, integrating factors, and adaptive RK45, I verify:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Phase-robust equivalence between $\tau$- and $\sigma$-evolution via Wronskian conservation, energy checks, and Bogoliubov coefficients $(\alpha_k,\beta_k)$.
\item Fixed-step RK stress tests in anti-damped $\sigma$-regimes display large amplitude error \emph{by design}; adaptive solvers remove this artifact.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Black holes with spatially varying $\Omega(r,t)$}\label{sec:schw}
For Schwarzschild $ds^2=-(1-r_s/r)dt^2+(1-r_s/r)^{-1}dr^2+r^2 d\Omega_2^2$ and a clock-based $\Omega(r,t)=1/(t\sqrt{1-r_s/r})$, I \emph{compute all invariants directly from} $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$. Because $\Omega$ has spatial dependence, $ \tilde R, \tilde R_{\mu\nu}\tilde R^{\mu\nu}, \tilde K$ receive derivative contributions from $\Omega$. Near the horizon $r\to r_s^+$, $\tilde R$ remains finite and the others have analytic limits that differ from naive $\Omega^{-4}$ scaling, as expected.

\section{Action, clock dynamics, and constraints}\label{sec:action}
Treating the clock $\tau$ as a scalar with action $S[g,\tau,\Phi]=\int d^4x\sqrt{-g}\,[\frac{1}{2\kappa}R - \frac{1}{2}(\nabla \tau)^2 - V(\tau) + \mathcal{L}_\Phi]$, variation yields Einstein equations with $T^{(\tau)}_{\mu\nu}=\nabla_\mu\tau\nabla_\nu\tau - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}(\nabla \tau)^2 - g_{\mu\nu}V(\tau)$ and the clock equation $\tau - V'(\tau)=0$. In FLRW these reduce to $\ddot \tau + 3H\dot \tau + V'(\tau)=0$ and the standard Hamiltonian constraint, matching my symbolic derivations.

\section{Numerical and symbolic validation}
I provide a comprehensive Python suite that checks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Invertibility and chain rule of the log-time map;
\item Unitary equivalence for constant and non-commuting $H(\tau)$, plus Heisenberg consistency;
\item Asymptotic silence: $H_{\rm eff}\to 0$ with finite phase;
\item FLRW curvature via Weyl identity and directly from $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$ (constant-curvature identities asserted);
\item Schwarzschild invariants from $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$ with symmetry and near-horizon checks;
\item QFT mode equivalence with adiabatic ICs, integrating factor, adaptive RK, Wronskian and Bogoliubov diagnostics.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion and outlook}
LTQG leaves QM intact while choosing a clock and geometry that regularize difficult regimes and stabilize computation. Immediate applications include: robust state preparation in early-universe QFT, controlled analysis of quenches in time-dependent Hamiltonians, and near-horizon field evolution with spatially varying conformal factors.

\paragraph*{Limitations and open work.}
I have focused on free fields and classical backgrounds. Interactions, backreaction, nontrivial topologies, and observational signatures remain to be explored. For black holes, alternative $\Omega$ choices may better capture near-horizon physics in specific setups.

\paragraph*{Community validation (disclaimer).}
\textbf{I propose LTQG in this paper as a candidate framework and report a complete set of mathematical and numerical checks supporting it. I explicitly invite independent replication and scrutiny of my derivations and code.} The validation suite is available (see Code Availability).
